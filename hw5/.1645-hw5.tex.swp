\subsection{a}
Each iteration is reliant on the previous one. So a[i] needs a[i-1] to be defined to be calculated.
\subsection{b}
a[i] holds the summation of 1 to i.  This can also be calculated as $\frac{n(n+1)} {2}$
\section{ }
This program gets significantly faster as more workers are added.  This can especially be seen on large inputs.\\
This follows the stencil pattern.
\section { }
The number of threads reduces the total runtime of the program, especially on larger inputs.
